            <h3>Early life</h3>
            <p class="firstParagraph">Aretha Louise Franklin was born on March 25, 1942, to Barbara (née Siggers) and Clarence LaVaughn "C. L." Franklin. She was delivered at her family's home located at 406 Lucy Avenue, Memphis, Tennessee. Her father was a Baptist minister and circuit preacher originally from Shelby, Mississippi, while her mother was an accomplished piano player and vocalist.[12] Both Mr. and Mrs. Franklin had children from prior relationships in addition to the four children they had together. When Aretha was two, the family relocated to Buffalo, New York.[13] By the time Aretha turned five, C. L. Franklin had permanently relocated the family to Detroit, where he took over the pastorship of the New Bethel Baptist Church.[14]</p>

            <h2>Aretha Franklin Among Women of the Century for Entertainment</h2>
            <p>"The “Queen of Soul” was a largely self-taught and gifted pianist and singer, recording many of her earliest tracks at her father’s Detroit church at age 14. Aretha Franklin eventually moved to New York, where she produced many hits, including “Respect” and “Freeway of Love.” She won 18 Grammys and was awarded the National Medal of the Arts and the Presidential Medal of Freedom. She was also the first female performer inducted into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame." - USA Today</p>
